You can install the package only with the required dependencies for your environment.

Using `pip`:

* For AWS:

```bash
pip install omegaconf-cloud-resolvers[aws]
```

* For GCP

```bash
pip install omegaconf-cloud-resolvers[gcp]
```

If you make  use of `hydra` to load your configuration as well, it needs to be installed separately:

```bash
pip install hydra-core
```
