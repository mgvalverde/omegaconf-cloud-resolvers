def register_custom_resolvers(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Registers multiple custom resolvers at once for OmegaConf.

    This function allows you to register multiple custom resolvers either by passing them as positional arguments
    or as keyword arguments. If only a callable is provided, the name used to register the callable will be its
    function name. If there are any name collisions between the positional and keyword arguments, a ValueError
    will be raised.

    Args:
        *args: Variable length list of callables to register as resolvers.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments where the key is the name of the resolver and the value is the callable.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If there are any name collisions between the positional and keyword arguments.

    Example:
        ```python
        def custom_resolver1():
            return "value1"
        def custom_resolver2():
            return "value2"
        register_custom_resolvers(custom_resolver1, custom_resolver2=my_custom_resolver2)
        ```
